#
# It prints a formatted list of all the pull request merged into base-ref from
# current-ref
#
# `base-ref` is supposed to be the last release reference (example: `tag-v0.1`)
# `current-ref` is the not yet released state (example: master)
#
# so `$ git not-released tag-v0.1 master` will list all the pull request merged
# since `tag-v0.1`
